# 2021-graphics
Code and assignments from CSCI3090 Computer Graphics using OpenGL. 

Despite the statistics on the *Languages* section, the majority of the code I wrote was in C/C++ or GLSL. 
Each project in this course is based off the example code provided by the professor on Canvas.
As a result, each example folder would contain files written in other languages.

A `.zip` folder for each example can be found in the `etc/lec/examples` directory.
Please note that some projects are based on the same example code.
